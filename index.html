SOFL+MSVL 2020 is an annual workshop on formal engineering methods in relation to the SOFL method and the MSVL method. 
SOFL stands for Structured Object-Oriented Formal Language and SOFL method is a representative formal engineering method. 
MSVL stands for Modelling, Specification, and Verification Language that supports temporary logic-based modeling and specification as well as model checking for verification. 
This workshop is always organized as a satellite event of International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM).
SOFL+MSVL 2022 is the 11th workshop in the workshop series.
