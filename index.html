                <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Title:</strong> Software Fault Injection Testing</p>

                <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Software reliability testing is traditionally
                    based on the inputs that a system is <i>expected</i> to receive during operation along with the
                    likelihood
                    that they will occur. Inputs that are more likely are more likely are the <i>nominal</i> inputs.
                    Inputs
                    that are less likely to occur are the <i>off-nominal</i> inputs. For critical systems, both types of
                    inputs
                    should be used during testing. However, there is yet a 3<sup>rd</sup> type of input that should be
                    considered
                    during V&V, and that is <i>corrupted</i> inputs. It is well known that with software, input data can
                    easily
                    be corrupted. So, the question becomes: What will the software do when that happens? Answering this
                    question is the role of <i>software fault injection testing</i>, and the focus of this talk.</p>

                    system design</p>

                <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Safety and security are key considerations in the
                    design of critical systems. Requirements analysis methods rely on the expertise and experience of
                    human intervention to make critical judgements. While human judgement is essential to an analysis
                    method, it is also valuable to ensure a degree of formality so that we reason about safety and
                    security at early stages of analysis and design, rather than detect problems later. Influenced by
                    ideas from STPA, this talk will present a hierarchical analysis process that aims to justify the
                    lower-level of design and flow-down of derived critical requirements arising from safety hazards and
                    security vulnerabilities identified at the higher-level design. At each level, we verify that the
                    design achieves the safety/security requirements by backing the analysis with formal modelling and
                    proof using Event-B refinement. The formal model helps to identify hazards/vulnerabilities arising
                    from the design and how they relate to the safety accidents/security losses being considered at this
                    level. We then re-apply the same process to each component of the design in a hierarchical manner.
                    Thus, we use ideas from STPA, backed by Event-B models, to drive the design, replacing the system
                    level requirements with component requirements. In doing so, we decompose critical requirements down
                    to components, transforming them from abstract system level requirements, towards concrete solutions
                    that we can implement correctly so that the hazards/vulnerabilities are eliminated.

                <strong>Bio:</strong> Michael Butler is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of
                Southampton, UK. He works in the area of mathematical methods for design and verification of safe
                and secure software-based systems, specialising in model-based formal methods, in particular Event-B.
                His research work encompasses applications, tools and methodology for formal methods. He has made
                key theoretical and methodological contributions to the Event-B formal method that enable it to
                scale to large complex systems. These contributions enable modular analysis in terms of how systems
                models are structured and analysed as well as methods for development of domain-specific
                mathematical theories that are reusable across multiple projects.</p>

                    Systems</p>

                <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Emphasis on system safety and reliability
                    assessment allowed us to place societal trust on mass-transportation and medical systems, energy,
                    space, financial and military infrastructures, and many other critical domains. As the technology
                    intrudes into all aspects of our lives, existing verification and validation approaches are not
                    sufficient anymore. In addition to meeting safety, reliability, and security standards, we expect
                    systems to protect our privacy, uphold equity, integrity and human rights, perform without biases,
                    and meet other stated and unstated expectations. Further, some of the logic embedded in software may
                    be the product of machine learning, making it unintuitive for humans to understand the rules it
                    encodes, thereby difficult to assess. In this talk, we will discuss software accountability
                    principles. Efforts to regulate software and services are increasing, with the goal of making
                    organizations and individuals more accountable for its consequences. But what constitutes
                    accountable software is not understood well. We will overview the outcomes of traditional software
                    safety assessment processes and compare them with emerging verification needs. Examples from
                    adaptive flight controls and airport passenger management will offer preliminary illustrations of
                    the dimensions of software accountability assurance. Our talk will conclude by outlining
                    opportunities for future research.</p>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Title:</strong> Reliability and availability of hardware-software systems
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Abstract:</strong>High reliability and availability are requirements for
                    most technical systems including computer and communication systems. Reliability and
                    availability assurance methods based on probabilistic models is the topic addressed in this
                    talk. Non-state-space solution methods are often used to solve models based on reliability block
                    diagrams, fault trees and reliability graphs. Relatively efficient algorithms are known to
                    handle systems with hundreds of components and have been implemented in many software packages.
                    Nevertheless, many practical problems cannot be handled by such algorithms. Bounding algorithms
                    are then used in such cases as was done for a major subsystem of Boeing 787. Non-state-space
                    methods derive their efficiency from the independence assumption that is often violated in
                    practice. State space methods based on Markov chains, stochastic Petri nets, semi-Markov and
                    Markov regenerative processes can be used to model various kinds of dependencies among system
                    components. Linux Operating System and WebSphere Application server are used as examples of
                    Markov models. IBM research cloud is used as an example of stochastic Petri net model. However,
                    the state space explosion of such models severely restricts the size of the problem that can be
                    solved. Hierarchical and fixed-point iterative methods provide a scalable alternative that
                    combines the strengths of state space and non-state-space methods and have been extensively used
                    to solve real-life problems. Real-world examples of such multi-level models from IBM, Cisco and
                    Sun Microsystems will be discussed. Hardware systems as well as software systems and their
                    combinations will be addressed via these examples. Novel approaches to software fault tolerance
                    will be discussed. </p>

                    LLC</strong><br/><strong>Bio:</strong>After retiring from Nokia Bell Labs in 2020 as a
                    Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Dr. Okumoto founded Sakura Software Solutions (3S),
                    which offers an interactive, real-time, online service for evaluating and improving quality of
                    software being developed. In collaboration with experts from industry and academia he has
                    developed a new innovative tool, STAR, for software quality assurance.
                    Kazu is a well-recognized pioneer in software reliability engineering. He invented a
                    world-famous statistical model for software reliability (known as “Goel – Okumoto model”). His
                    co-authored book on software reliability is a most frequently referenced book in this field. And
                    he has an impressive list of book chapters, keynote addresses, and numerous technical papers to
                    his credit.
                    Since joining Bell Labs in 1980, Kazu worked on many exciting projects for (original) AT&T,
                    Lucent, Alcatel Lucent, and Nokia. He successfully developed software design for reliability as
                    a best practice within Nokia. He has 13 years of management experience, including Bell Labs
                    Field Representative in Japan. He was an Assistant Professor at Rutgers University. He completed
                    his Ph.D. (1979) and MS (1976) at Syracuse University, and BS (1974) at Hiroshima University.

                    revolutionary Approach
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Abstract:</strong>In this tutorial we will introduce a real-time interactive
                    cloud-based tool, STAR, which implements a revolutionary approach to zero-touch automation for
                    defect prediction. It enables quick and easy decision making across the development cycle to
                    ensure high quality software. Available in STAR, our dynamic tool allows you to see the
                    real-time impact that multiple corrective actions have on software quality & delivery schedule.
                    It really is the most straightforward representation of software quality assurance. It is now
                    available for anybody anytime and anywhere. We will provide a live demonstration of STAR to
                    highlight input data and several output views with state-of-the-art user interface and
                    visualization techniques. From pioneering research in software systems reliability, data
                    networking and reliable distributed computing, to creating fundamental breakthroughs in the
                    understanding and automation of robust software delivery, we pushed the known limits of
                    computing science and how to capitalize on these advances for practical technological
                    innovations. We successfully integrated these innovations into software design for reliability
